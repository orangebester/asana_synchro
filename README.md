1. Insert your personal_data into personal_data.py
2. Launch code by running main.py

Frequent troubles:
If your access token "*.pickle" is outdated just delete it and launch code again. You will need to authorise your web-application one more time.

Important: 

Before launching code prepare your web-applications to work with Google Drive API
